This is a .batch file (and requisite other files) that you can schedule using Window's built in Task Scheduler to run automatic Bandwidth monitoring. It uses Ookla's SpeedTest CLI for testing, Git's install with Unix/Linx commands for GREP and GAWK for some filtering, and Discord for notifications!

There is a missing file that you need to create for it to send to Discord. Just create a credentials.txt with the webhook you want and it will send the notifications there!
